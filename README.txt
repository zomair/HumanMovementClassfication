Final Project 

## File List
---------------------
classify.ipynb          -- Neural Net (MLP) implementation
data.mat		-- Saved data for Neural Net


## Note
---------------------
CAUTION: The test data is confidential, and has not been uploaded to the public git.
- For classify.ipynb, some cells may take a while to run (but less than 30min)



## Usage
---------------------
Run each cell in the classify.ipynb EXCEPT for the ones with comments DO NOT RUN

---------------------
Run each cell in the ContourClassifier.ipynb, Frequency domain PCA.ipynb, Time and Frequency PCA.ipynb and Time domain PCA.ipynb. These correspond to Contour extraction (table 1, column 4), frequency domain PCA (table 1, column 2)
, time domain PCA (table 1, column 1) and PCA on the flattened data (table 1, column 3), NosOfComponents refers to the number of principal components, maximum 100. For principal components number>50, each run takes about 15 minutes.
